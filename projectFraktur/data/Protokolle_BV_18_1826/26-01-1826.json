This is a generally recognised principle of\r\nprinciple of constitutional law, which has been confirmed by several treaties of peace and\r\nand peace treaties of older and more recent times, and in particular by \u00a7\u00a7. 77 and 78 of the\r\nof 1803; as is also confirmed even in that expert opinion of the Grand Ducal\r\nof Aug. 8, 1807, on which the decree of the secret finance department of the\r\nBaden Secret Finance Department of 22nd March 1808, right at the beginning, under the general\r\nthe general rules of law applicable to the debt settlement of fragmented countries.\r\nthe sentence is placed at the head of the general legal rules:\r\nthat each ceded land, as a rule, with all encumbrances, consequently\r\nwith all the debts attached to it, to the new owner.\r\npassed to the new owner.\r\nIn accordance with this principle, which is formally and publicly recognised by the Grand Duchy of Baden itself as being\r\nand publicly acknowledged by the Grand Duchy of Baden itself, the Lit.\r\nthe Rhine Palatinate on this side, is unobjectionable at the time of the cession of this land.to its new owners pro rata of their shares, and the latter may, in the absence of specific contracts to the contrary\r\nthe latter, in the absence of specific contracts to the contrary, cannot evade the obligation to pay them.\r\nthe latter, in the absence of specific contracts to the contrary, cannot evade the obligation to pay it, and cannot demand the assumption of this debt from the previous\r\nthe previous regent who had ceded the land, as is also provided for in the above-mentioned\r\nof the Grand Ducal Department of Justice of Aug. 8, 1807, sub num. 4.\r\ndisertis verbis. An amendment to the above principle with respect to the ceded\r\nof the Rhine Palatinate that derogates from the above principle is, by the way, as little to be found in the\r\nthe Imperial Deputation of 1803 than in any of the other subsequent state treaties.\r\nthe existence of such a provision on the part of the Grand Duke of Baden is not even stated.\r\nBaden is not even stated, let alone proven. The claim made by the\r\nThe assertion made by the representative of the Grand Duchy of Baden, however:\r\n\"that in the settlement of the claims made to the Elector of Palatinate-Bavaria for the\r\na for the part of the Palatinate on the left bank of the Rhine that was ceded to France.\r\n\"not only the actual loss of land and people and income, but also the loss\r\n2ten, but also the loss of revenues suffered during the war as a result of the enemy occupation.\r\n\"loss of revenue suffered during the war as a result of the enemy occupation\",\r\nwould, even if it were to be fully proven in fact, nevertheless imply a liability on the part of the\r\nCrown of Bavaria to assume the part of that debt which is liable to the Rhine Palatinate on this side.\r\nof that debt, because for this, according to what has been said above in accordance with the\r\nabove, in agreement with the own explanations of the Grand Ducal=Badisch\r\nof the Grand Ducal Department of Justice on this subject, a special contract would have been required.\r\nwhich, however, is completely lacking.\r\n2) The Rhine Palatinate on the other side was occupied by the French army at the time the debt was contracted.\r\noccupied by the French army at the time of the contracting of the debt, and the Elector Carl Theodor was not in\r\nin actual possession of it. However, this did not mean that he ceased to be the legal\r\nand owner of this part of the country in the legal sense, rather he was as such\r\nas such, he was indisputably authorised and entitled to all acts of regent with regard to it.\r\nand could therefore also contract debts for and on the same in a legally valid manner.\r\nfor and on behalf of it.\r\nThe opposing assertion of the advocate of the Crown of Bavaria is in conflict with the well-known\r\nprinciples of European international law. For all teachers of state and\r\nteachers of international law agree with it:that the hostile military occupation of a province never extinguishes the right to which the\r\nthe right of the previous ruler to it never expires, and that only then does he\r\nhe either expressly or tacitly relinquishes it, or if he has lost all reasonable\r\nhas lost all reasonable hope of ever regaining the actual possession of the province, he may\r\nprovince, he ceases to be regent of it in the legal sense.\r\nVattel droit des gens, Liv.

It\r\nthe part of those schools which were originally liable on the other side of the Rhine Palatinate and which were not\r\nand not taken over by France, had to be transferred to other countries; and in this respect the\r\nIn this regard, \u00a7 38 of the Reichsdeputations-Hauptschluss of 25 Feb. 1803 stipulated and ordered that\r\nstipulated and ordered:\r\nthat the imperial estates indemnified for their possessions on the other side of the Rhine shall retain their,\r\npersonal debts, as well as those arising from the aforementioned possessions, on their\r\nthe aforementioned possessions, to their domains and revenuses received as compensation and to\r\nand redeem them from the same.\r\nThe applicability of this imperial land law in the present case to the Crown of Bavaria can be\r\nBavaria can suffer all the less concern, because the same, according to the\r\nthe Imperial Deputation of 1803, for the Rhenish Palatinate on the other side, by other German\r\nGerman imperial lands on this side of the Rhine. There\r\nthe Grand Duke of Baden and the other owners of the Rhine Palatinate on this side of the Rhine are pro rata\r\nRhine Palatinate pro rata of their shares in the same, and the Crown of Bavaria for the other side.\r\nRhine Palatinate, are to be regarded as debtors of the Rhenish Palatinate state loan lit.\r\nto represent the same to the holders of the partial bonds in question.\r\nIn the meantime, on the part of the Crown of Bavaria, under the name of Ein=\r\nvarious factual objections, partly aimed at contesting the cause of action, partly actual exceptions,\r\nand partly real exceptions; it will therefore still require further investigation.\r\nfurther investigation into the matter:\r\nwhether and to what extent the Crown of Bavaria, through those defences of concurrence, is obliged to represent the\r\nbinding obligation to represent the Rhenish-Palatinate loan in question, lit.\r\ncould be released?\r\nThe first objection is:\r\ne mortgage is constituted exclusively on this side of the Rhine Palatinate2.\r\nThis is partly factually quite incorrect, in that, according to the literal content of the bond of July 1, 1948\r\nof the bond of July 1, 1796, the Upper Palatinate states named therein are just as and in\r\nand in exactly the same way as the Rhenish Palatine Ober\u00e4mter of Heidelberg and Mosbach.\r\nbach, for the quaest. The same is the case with the Upper Palatinate states named therein. On the other hand, the same\r\nis also quite irrelevant for its own sake, because, as has already been noted above,Here it is not a question of the extent of the mortgages granted to the creditors as accessor\r\nthe mortgages granted to the creditors as a means of accessor y security, but on the definitive determination and\r\nthe relationship of the debtors among themselves, and in this connection only the question can be considered: for which country the debt was originally contracted.\r\nfor which country the debt was originally contracted?\r\nEqually irrelevant is the second objection, which consists of:\r\n\"the loan in question was used exclusively for the Rhine Palatinate on this side\".\r\nA determination of the factual correctness of this assertion would not lead to any result\r\nwould lead to no result, because here everything depends only on: for whom the school is contracted?\r\nand in view of the character of the debt assumed above as a Rhenish Palatinate debt, the\r\nRhenish Palatinate, i.e. affecting the parts of the Electorate of Palatinate located on both\r\nof the Electorate of Palatinate located on both banks of the Rhine, the way in which the borrowed\r\nis quite indifferent to this or that part of the land. The borrowed monies are, however, really to be used for the benefit of the\r\nused for the benefit of the Rhine Palatinate on the other side, in so far as the expenses of the war armaments are\r\nof the war armaments, which were made in particular for the purpose of\r\nto free that part of the country from the hostile French occupation.\r\nThe third objection\r\n\"the debt is due to the peace treaties of L\u00fcneville and Paris of 9 February and 24 August 1801.\r\n\"and August 24, 1801, and by special government decrees and orders of the Regent on the\r\nof the Regent on this side of the Rhine Palatinate \",\r\nfinds its refutation in what has just been indicated in the relevant articles of the aforementioned peace treaties.\r\nof the peace treaties mentioned above. According to this, however, the possession of the Rhine\r\nof the debt on the Rhine Palatinate on this side remained the burden of this part of the country; the quota\r\nthe other Rhenish Palatinate, however, had to be paid in accordance with \u00a7 38 of the Reichsdepu\r\nof 1803, to the compensation lands assigned to the Elector of Bavaria for this purpose.\r\nto the Elector of Bavaria. However, special government decrees and\r\nprovisions of the Regent by which the entire debt was transferred to the Rhine Palatinate on this side.\r\nthe whole of the debt to the Palatinate on this side of the Rhine.\r\nthe original nature of the debt, as contracted for the entire Rhine Palatinate, as well as the\r\nas the proportionate co-liability of the Rhineland Palatinate, as stipulated in \u00a7 38 of the Reichsdeputations-Hauptschluss of 1803.\r\nthe Elector of Bavaria for the Rhenish Palatinate on the other side.\r\nThe fourth plea is that the land of compensation granted to the Elector of Bavaria for the Rhenish Palatinate on the other side of the Rhine cannot be annulled or altered.\r\nThe fourth plea\r\n\"exceptio rei judicatae\",\r\nis based in part on the provisions of the subdelegated Imperial Execution Commission of 1804.\r\nProt. d. d. Bundesvers. XVIII. Vol.against the present owners of the Rhenish Palatinate on this side, partly to the mandate of S. C.\r\nagainst the same by the Imperial Chamber Court in 1806.\r\nNeither from these, nor from this, however, can a legal force be derived which would benefit the Crown of Bavaria.\r\nCrown of Bavaria can be derived. The Imperial Execution Commission was, according to the\r\n35 of the Reichsdeputations=Hauptschluss of 1803, was only to take care of the execution of the\r\nthe implementation of the resolutions laid down in the preceding sections of this State Treaty\r\nIt was therefore not a judicial but only an executive authority;\r\nits decrees can therefore never be regarded as judicial findings, and for that very reason are\r\nand for this very reason are quite incapable of having any actual force of law. Also, the\r\nThe decrees they have appealed to are only provisional in favour of the creditors;\r\nBut they are so far removed from resolving the dispute over the distribution of the debt between the\r\nthe owners of the Rhine Palatinate on this side and the other side, that they rather\r\nthe absolute incompetence of that commission, and to give the owners of this side of the Rhine\r\nthe owners of the Rhine Palatinate on this side of the Rhine their claims for recourse against the Electorate of Palatinate-Bavaria.\r\nexpre\u00df reserve. For this reason, the petitions submitted by the princes concerned to the Imperial Execution Commission are not binding.\r\nCommission, as only the provisional arrangement ordered in favour of the creditors.\r\nthe creditors, are completely irrelevant here. The un\r\nmandate of the Imperial Chamber Court of 1806 could not be considered a vires rei judici\r\nfor the very reason that before the expiry of the ad paritionem time limit set therein, the same\r\nwithin which it could also have been challenged per exceptiones sub-et obreptionis.\r\nthe Act of Confederation of the Rhine was concluded and the imperial constitution and imperial courts thereby dissolved.\r\nand imperial courts were dissolved, which is why it was not reproduced.\r\nhas not been reproduced. Moreover, this mandate, too, was intended only for the immediate determination of the\r\nthe relationship between the creditors and the owners of the Rhine Palatinate on this side, and therefore remains\r\nthe relationship between the creditors and the owners of the Rhine Palatinate on this side.\r\nThe fifth objection is derived from the fact that the debtor is the owner of the Rhine Palatinate on this side and on the other.\r\nThe fifth objection is derived from the assertion:\r\na the Elector of Palatinate-Bavaria has only granted the Rhine Palatinate on this side under the\r\na indispensable condition of the assumption of all the debts of the Rhenish Palatinate.\r\ne ceded 2.\r\nThis objection, too, turns out to be irrelevant, because the assumption of the debt on the\r\nof the debt on this side of the Rhine Palatinate is self-evident according to the above-mentioned general rule.\r\nthe above-mentioned general rule, a transfer of the part of the debt owed to the Rhine Palatinate on that side.\r\nthe Rhine Palatinate on the other side, however, is not actually once asserted, as also the\r\nthe agreement in this respect between the Bavarian envoy and the ministers of the mediatingnegotiations that are said to have taken place in Paris would not be prejudicial to the Grand Duke of Baden.\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Baden for the sake of this alone, because the latter is not\r\nnegotiations, and because in the Imperial Deputation of 1803, the cession of the\r\n1803, by which the cession of the Rhine Palatinate on this side was effected, there is no mention of such a condition.\r\ncondition occurs.\r\nThe sixth objection is:\r\ns the Crown of Bavaria has not been fully compensated for the Rhenish Palatinate.\r\nJn the details of the arguments put forward by both litigants to substantiate and refute this assertion.\r\nboth litigating parties to substantiate and refute this assertion.\r\nis, however, quite superfluous in the circumstances. For the compensation of the Crown\r\nfor all the lands ceded by the Peace of L\u00fcneville and the Imperial Deputation of 1803.\r\nof 1803 has been determined after prior negotiations on the subject, and has been\r\nand determined in the last-mentioned treaty; the Crown of Bavaria has stipulated this\r\nthe Crown of Bavaria has actually received this compensation in stipulated measure, and on the same\r\nthe part of the debt in question on the other side of the Rhine Palatinate.\r\nTherefore, now that all this has been established by treaty, it can be decided whether the quantum of the debt to the Crown of Bavaria is to be paid.\r\nof the compensation paid to the Crown of Bavaria was commensurate with its loss?\r\nto the loss of the same? there can be no question at all any more. Even if this should not be the case\r\nthe present dispute, nothing can be concluded from this, because the obligation of the\r\nbecause the obligation of the Crown of Bavaria to proportionately co-represent the Lit.\r\nof the Lit. D debt not according to the extent of the compensation received for the Rhenish Palatinate beyond\r\nbut from the original nature of the debt, as contracted for the whole of the Rhenish Palatinate.\r\nRhenish Palatinate, and according to the provisions made for its assumption in the various peace treaties and state\r\nThe seventh plea must be raised by the defendant.\r\nThe seventh plea is\r\nthe \"exceptio plus petitionis\".\r\nIf this objection were merely to refer to the fact that the petition of the Grand Duchy of\r\nBaden on the 4 Rhenish Palatinate state loans sub lit. A, B, C and D to the total amount of 6,000,000.\r\nthe total amount of 6,000,000 fl.; thus it would have to be considered substantial and\r\nto be considered substantial, and to that extent it is also limited by the known restriction of the object\r\nlitis to the as yet unpaid partial bonds of the loan under lit. D. However\r\nin relation to the joint liability of the Crown of Bavaria for the Rhenish Palatinate on the other side.\r\nRhenish Palatinate, it cannot bring about any change, and this remains in force as before\r\neven if the Grand Duchy of Baden has gone too far in its claims and applications.\r\ngone too far.From this then arises the relevance of the plea of the plus petition, and that there=\r\nthat a complete exemption of the Crown of Bavaria from the proportionate co-representation of the debt in question cannot be\r\nof the debt in question cannot be justified by itself.\r\nThe eighth plea,\r\n\"the exceptio compensationis\",\r\nis no less completely inadmissible in the circumstances. In justification of this plea\r\nis stated:\r\nces seyen during the French War from the Baierische Cassen before and\r\n\"and after, under the express condition of restitution, many advances were paid to the\r\ns made to the Rheinpf\u00e4lzische Generalcasse at Mannheim:,\r\nand these advances are to be reimbursed by the Crown of Bavaria in the event that the same\r\nthe representation of the quaest. debt should be imposed on it in whole or in part, as if the\r\njecta compensationis in return. However, according to known legal regulations, compensation\r\nAccording to known legal provisions, compensation can only occur where there is a mutuum debitum ac cre\r\nditum exists. Therefore, the exceptio compensationis would not be possible because of supposed\r\ncounterclaims of the Crown of Bavaria against the Grand Duchy of Baden would only be permissible if the latter\r\nthe latter forms a claim against the Crown of Bavaria, and the latter is able to defend itself against this\r\nwould have to defend itself against this by means of defences. This case does not exist, however, since the\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Baden's claim merely seeks to have the obligation to pay a third party's\r\nobligation to pay the claim of a third party from itself and to pass it on to the Crown of\r\nBavaria. The decision of this dispute, which only involves the determination of the actual\r\nof the actual debtor of the claiming creditors of the Rhenish-Palatinate loan.\r\nlit. D, other claims and counterclaims, which these two states have ex alio fundamento\r\nand counterclaims which these two states may have ex alio fundamento against each other, cannot have the slightest\r\nhave any effect whatsoever. Such claims by one or other of the states concerned, which have no\r\nwhich have no bearing on the rights of the litigation creditors do not form part of the objecto litis.\r\ndo not belong to the objecto litis, and not to the competence of the court of extradition, as both are\r\nby Art. 30 of the Vienna Final Act and by the resolution of the Federal Assembly of 15 February.\r\nof 15 Feb. 1821; and as little as the reconvention directed to the award of these counterclaims\r\nthe Crown of Bavaria, as a foreign state which is not suitable for a decision by a court of\r\nforeign subject matter not suitable for adjudication by a court of law, just as little can the\r\nthe Crown of Bavaria cannot be permitted to assert those foreign counterclaims by way of compensation.\r\ncounterclaims by way of compensation, and in this way to obtain a ruling on them.\r\nand, in this way, to cause a decision to be made on them by the Austr\u00e4galgericht.Finally, ninthly\r\nthe plea of renunciation and respectively of preclusion or prescription\r\non the basis of \u00a7 45 of the Reichsdeputations-Hauptschluss of 1803 and Art. 12 of the\r\nArticle 12 of the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine of July 12, 1806.\r\nApart from the fact that this objection would not be taken into consideration for formal\r\nwould have to be taken into account, because it would only be contrary to the known provision of the I. R. A. of the duplicate.\r\nof the duplicate, and that there is no justa causa restitu tionis against this omission.\r\ntionis against this omission is completely lacking; therefore, the same is also materially\r\nthe reason mentioned above that it is not a question here of a claim,\r\nthat this is not a matter of a claim of the Grand Duchy of Baden against the states of the\r\nStates of the King of Bavaria,\r\nwhich is governed by the provisions of the Imperial Deputation Act of 180.\r\nand the Confederation of the Rhine Act of 1806; but that here only\r\nthat only the duty to satisfy the claims of third parties is spoken of here.\r\nof third parties,\r\nin respect of which it is quite indifferent if perhaps one of the debtors should have neglected to pay\r\nof his possible future right of recourse against his co-debtor binner, as prescribed by subsequent\r\nthe period prescribed for this purpose by subsequent state treaties.\r\nIf the Rhenish-Palatinate state loan lit.\r\nfor the entire Rhenish Palatinate on this side and on the other, which after the\r\nof this land by the present owners of the part on this side pro rata, as they have participated in it.\r\npart of it, and for the part on the other side by the Crown of Bavaria out of the\r\nthe Crown of Bavaria from the indemnity lands received for it; so now the question is to be considered\r\nthe question must now be considered:\r\naccording to which principles the concurrence ratio of the states involved is to be determined?\r\nstates to be determined?\r\nIn this respect, the information contained in the acts of both parties concerning the\r\nand the Rhine Palatinate on the other side provide a sufficient yardstick and guide,\r\nand there will therefore be no need for further investigation.\r\nThe lawyer of the Grand Duchy of Baden gives in \u00a7 5 of the replica, on the basis of an excerpt from the accounts, the following\r\nfrom the accounts of the Rhenish Palatinate General Treasury, the amount of the annual net\r\nof the annual net revenues of the entire Rhine Palatinate from the years 1781 to 1790\r\n1,462,000 fl. on average, whereby the income of the Rhine Palatinate on this side of the Rhine\r\nof the Rhine Palatinate on the other side are said to be 2 to 3. This information and explanation\r\nThe Grand Duchy of Baden must accept this information and explanation without hesitation.On the part of the Crown of Bavaria, on the other hand, under Num. XXXVIII for consultation\r\nthe tableau of the losses and cessions of Palatinate-Bavaria, which is the basis for the\r\nof Palatinate-Bavaria, and to the same in actis, namely in the duplicate \u00a7. 5, is expressly referred to.\r\nin which the revenu of the Rhine Palatinate on the other side is valued at 1,490,000 fl,\r\nbut those of this side are assessed at 940,000 bn.\r\nIt is true that these are the gross revues. But that makes no difference, because\r\ndifference, because all that matters here is to determine the relationship of the two parts of the country to one another, and it\r\nand in this respect it must always lead to one and the same result, whether one uses the gross\r\nresult, whether the gross or the net income is taken as the basis for the\r\nthe basis of the calculation. No objection can therefore be raised by the Crown of Bavaria against the use of the data contained in that table.\r\ntherefore no objection can be made on the part of the Crown of Bavaria. If one compares\r\nthe sums of the revenue of the territories situated on both banks of the Rhine are compared.\r\nof the Rhine with each other, it is true that the Grand Duchy of Baden has a somewhat higher\r\nduchy of Baden, in that out of the total amount of\r\n2,430,000 fl.; = 972,000 fl. would make up. However, since the attorney for the\r\nBaden has not only previously himself determined the ratio of 3 for this side, and \u00bd for the other side.\r\nand \u00bd for the Rhine Palatinate on the other side, but in particular also in \u00a7. 5\r\nof the replica duris verbis:\r\n\"that also according to that tableau the ratio of the gross revenues of the this\r\n\"and the other part of the land is 2 to 3\",\r\nneither of the litigants can complain of this, if the result of their mutual\r\nthe result of their mutual judicial concessions of % to* as the basis for the decision in the\r\nis accepted as the basis of the decision in respect of the quotation.\r\nAccording to this proportion, therefore, the holders of the still unpaid pari\r\nof the loan lit. D or their surrogates from the loan lit. b from the farms involved.\r\nbe satisfied pro rata by the courts involved.\r\nFinally, the attorney for the Crown of Bavaria has to\r\na) the edition of the agreements between the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Grand Duchy of\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Baden, the Grand Duchy of Hesse=Darmstadt and the Duchy of Nassau.\r\nby which the former assumed the shares of the latter states in the debt in question.\r\nassumed,\r\nand\r\nb) the presentation of those acts which determine the number of partial bonds of the\r\nthe number of partial obligations of the loan lit.of their silvering, likewise on the quantity already paid at the time of the assignment of this\r\nof the debt already paid at the time of the cession of this Rhine Palatinate.\r\nand information on the amount of the debt already paid,\r\ndemanded. This demand, however, lacks any legal basis. For the acti\r\nlegitimation of the Grand Duchy of Baden, for the rectification of which the Crown of Baia\r\n2 of the consultation demands the edition of the aforementioned treaties, is not guaranteed by the\r\nof the Grand Ducal Government of Hesse to the minutes of the Federal Assembly of 15 July 1822.\r\nof 15 July 1822 and by the Ducal-Nassau Minister in the proce\r\nthe proceedings before the court of extradition, that the ruling to be made in this matter in future\r\nand to accept the decision to be made in this matter in the future for their part as well.\r\nalready sufficiently procured; it is therefore no longer necessary for this final purpose to submit the said\r\nis no longer necessary for this final purpose.\r\nFurthermore, as is well known, the plaintiff need only produce such documents to the defendant\r\nwhich may be useful for the defence of the latter in the proceedings.\r\nMartin Lehrb. d. gem. Proc., \u00a7. 241.\r\nIn the present case, therefore, the contracts and documents in question would only belong to this if the\r\nonly belong to this if the Crown of Bavaria is thereby released from the concurrence to satisfy the holders of the\r\nof the holders of the partial bonds of the Rhenish Palatinate loan lit.\r\ncould be freed.\r\nIn the meantime, they do not have this property at all. The contracts between the\r\nGrand Duchies of Baden and Hesse=Darmstadt and the Duchy of Nassau refer, of course, only to this\r\nof course relate only to the Rhenish Palatinate on this side, and to the share of the debt that affects this\r\nquota of the debt. For the Crown of Bavaria, however, which does not owe a part of the debt to the Grand Duchy of\r\nof the debt to the Grand Duchy of Baden, but which, according to the nature of the pledge\r\nthe nature of the loan against the creditors, it is necessary for the Crown of\r\nit is quite indifferent to know in what manner and on what conditions the debtor is to be held liable,\r\nin what manner and on what terms the rulers of the Rhine Palatinate on this side\r\ntheir contribution to their quota.\r\nIn the same way, since the objectum litis is shown to exist only in the part of the Lit.\r\nthe unpaid part of the Lit. D debt - no less it does not belong here at all,\r\nand on the obligation of the Crown of Bavaria, as well as on its defence, cannot have any influence.\r\nquestions: whether perhaps a part of the partial obligations of that loan has not been put into\r\nor in what way another part of the same has already been redeemed?\r\ntherefore the requested edition of the acts that could provide information on these questions was\r\nthe requested edition of the acts that could provide information on these questions as irrelevant.This request for an edition appears even more unacceptable in so far as its actual and main\r\ntendency is stated by the Crown of Bavaria itself to be to know\r\na to know with whom the Crown of Bavaria has to deal with its most considerable counter-demands?\r\nwith for the sake of its very considerable counter demands?\r\nFor, as is well known, the rule suffers that the plaintiff must give the defendant omnia in\r\nto the defendant all in strumenta ad fundandam exceptionem, in the case of an exception, si editio petatura.\r\nexception, si editio petatur ad efsectum reconventionis,\r\nPufendorf introd. in process. civil.
